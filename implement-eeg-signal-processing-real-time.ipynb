This analysis is crucial in several contexts:\n\n1. Sleep Studies\nSleep Stages Classification: Different sleep stages (e.g., REM, NREM) are characterized by distinct frequency patterns. PSD helps identify these stages by highlighting the dominant frequencies associated with each stage.\n\nMental State Analysis: Different cognitive states (e.g., attention, relaxation) are associated with specific EEG frequency bands (e.g., alpha, beta). PSD helps in quantifying these states by analyzing the power in these frequency bands.\n\nMental Health Assessment: Conditions like depression and anxiety can manifest as specific changes in EEG frequency content. PSD analysis can aid in the assessment and understanding of these mental health conditions.\n\nNoise and Artifact Identification: By analyzing the PSD, it is possible to identify and remove noise and artifacts (e.g., muscle activity, eye blinks) from EEG signals, leading to cleaner and more accurate data for further analysis.\n\n**Tasks**\nmake compariosn beetwen data for evening and morinig\n\n**Expectation**\nShould be detected visually some deiffrence beetwen entropy for4 eveninf and morning.
